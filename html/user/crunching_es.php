changelog
	squalyl  2010 apr 26 	- display details for numbers queued for post processing
				- removed XML bits
	squalyl  2010 apr 27	- added the "estimated pending relations" column
	debrouxl 2010 apr 27	- changed the "Now crunching" comment and the "~ Pending Rels" title 
	squalyl	 2010 apr 30	- avoided div/0 when received_relations was zero and computing pending relations
	debrouxl 2010 may 08	- slightly reduced the indication on the minimum numbers of relations 
				  (223251500 relations on 10003_250 showed significant oversieving)
	squalyl  2011 aug 26    - add indication of order, to allow counting number per category
